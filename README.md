# Hamurusti

Build your empire, feed your people, make history!

Hamurusti is an homage to one of the first strategy video games, *Hamurabi*, written in 1968 by Doug Dyment. You can read more about the history of [*Hamurabi* at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi_%28video_game%29).

*Hamurabi* was originally written in the FOCAL language and then ported to BASIC in 1973. Hamurusti is written in Rust.

You play the ruler of an ancient kingdom. You have ten years to defend and grow your population, defending them against poor harvest, plague and rat infestations.

You will need Rust installed to compile the program. The easiest way to install Rust is [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Compile the program with `cargo build` or compile and build in one step with `cargo run`.

This is a text-based game that runs in the terminal. The game will ask you questions that you must answer to make decisions about your kingdom.
